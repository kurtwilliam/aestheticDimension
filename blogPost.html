					<p class="postContent">The renowned 19th century philosopher Hegel discusses a brilliant concept, termed Second Nature. The meaning of Hegel’s concept of second nature is basically things that are outside ourselves that we take to be the natural reigning order. Specifically, it can be understood that things and institutions created by man are understood by most as a second nature. In more plain terms, and for the purposes of our discussion, it is those things that we take for granted as our reality — when they are in fact created by other people -that are a second nature.</p>
					<p class="postContent">With this understanding, everything from having a chair to sit on to the existence of government is a second nature to most. However, quickly, we can imagine the world as being far different without these things.</p>
					<p class="postContent">For example, much of the world woke up to the election of Trump to see a certain order they took for granted shaken to its core. One of the reasons I believe this moment was so shocking for many was because they took the continuing civil order, which would have been continued by his opponent, as almost to the level of a second nature.</p>
					<p class="postContent">I also believe that this is one of the strongest arguments on the important of design, and for empowering designers. All businesses are seeking to grow and be economically sustainable. History is littered with examples of jobs and business that have become outdated. And maintaining up-to-date design is now more important than ever in the success of any organizations.</p>

					<p class="postContent">Remember Nokia? Nokia was effectively a second nature in its prime, but ultimately failed to keep up. The current second nature is the iPhone — to which Apple has keenly used design to build to this status.</p>
